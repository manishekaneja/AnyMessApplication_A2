        <p>MessageME is a platform where you can recive messages from an anonymous person. <strong>Only thing which you
                have
                to do is register yourself in this Application and share the link publicly.</strong>
            It will help you in getting some feedback.</p>

                <p>
                    Sorry but we can't do that. The whole concept is based on being anonymous which sending message or
                    giving feedback.
